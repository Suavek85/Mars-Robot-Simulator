# Martian Robots coding challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It's a very basic app which allows sending instructions to a robots via text field. The robots then in return proccess information and sequentially execute the moves on a specified grid and send back an updated position of their position on the grid.

The whole set up for the app is very basic (e.g. minimal styling, no testing) as the purpose of the challenge is to code the core functionality only. The code can be definitely further refactored and improved, but the core functionality should work.
